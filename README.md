# Last Video I Swear

Last Video I Swear is a chrome extension designed to halt an endless YouTube binge - for when you should be working 📖, or finally going to sleep 💤.

The extension, when activated, will darken the area around your YouTube video and make it unclickable (keeping the related video section out of reach). When your video finishes, the extension will take care of the hardest part, and close the tab for you ❌.
